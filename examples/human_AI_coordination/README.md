# Toy Cooperation Environment

Here, we show how to load trained RL agents to play with human participants in a multi-agent task.

To get started, run

```bash
python web_app.py
```

This will start a web app where you can play the game with the RL agents. To view how we loaded them in, check out the `experiment.py` file.
